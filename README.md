This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving the use of `setInterval` within the `useEffect` hook.  The provided code snippet shows an example of how to introduce a memory leak by failing to include a cleanup function to stop the interval when the component unmounts.  The solution provided shows how to correctly implement the `setInterval` with proper cleanup to resolve this issue. This issue is particularly important to address as memory leaks can significantly impact the performance and stability of applications, leading to degraded user experiences and potential crashes.
